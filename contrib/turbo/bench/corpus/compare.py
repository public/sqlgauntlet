"""compare.py <dir> [arms...]: corpus/run.sh check's <arm>.check.tsv against stock's, statement by statement. A
statement agrees when status, row count, changes and error text are the same and its rows hash the same: in order
when it has ORDER BY (prep.py's ordered flag), as a multiset otherwise; statements tagged wallclock (they read the
clock) only by row count, as the corpus says. Prints the disagreements (each one a bug to
reduce), statements that fail or disagree with themselves in stock too, and how many executions each arm served."""
