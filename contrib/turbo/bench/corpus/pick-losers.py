"""pick-losers.py <series-dir> [older-series-dir] > bench/corpus/losers.tsv: the loser micro-corpus for the fast loop
(run.sh cg locally, the corpusfast Xeon workload), from Xeon corpus series (corpus/run.sh speed's TSVs and q/, as
gathered for summarise.py). A loser is consistently over 1.02x stock in hot or prep: its time's bootstrap interval is
above 1.02 in the newer series and its instructions over 1.02 in both. Each is given one cause:
  unserved      never served, so it pays serving's checks for nothing (writes, vtabs, FTS)
  small         served, hot loser, stock under 100k instructions: serving's fixed cost on a small lookup
  sort          served, hot loser, larger, with ORDER BY / a temp B-tree / GROUP BY / top-N
  big           served, hot loser, larger, otherwise
  prep-reoffer  a prep-only loser in the newer series that the older did not serve (a binding's re-prepare, c85cc3b;
                the newer series alone decides, as the older one never served it)
  prep          any other prep-only loser (prepare + finalize cost)
  time-only     a loser in time but not in instructions (named only): callgrind can't judge it, the Xeon can
and two kinds of guard, which must not get worse:
  win           clear wins, hot (instructions under 0.9 in both series)
  parity        served hot-small statements that are not losers (at most 1.05 instructions), closest to 1 first
Named statements (NAMED) are kept whatever their rank. Within a cause the largest instruction excess comes first, at
most 2 per application, statements over MAXMS stock ms (hot) left out so a callgrind pass stays in minutes.
Output, from the newer series: id, project, cause, then instructions per execution (stock hot, serve hot, stock prep,
serve prep) and stock's hot ms: the baseline. The statements themselves, in corpus order with their projects'
databases: IDS=bench/corpus/losers.tsv python3 bench/corpus/prep.py <dir> (<project>.q and <project>.build.sql, which
corpus.c runs as they are)."""
